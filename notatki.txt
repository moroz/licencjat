To be empty means to be empty of ego, to be without any thought of self, not in the sense that one functions as a vegetable or a wild animal - living things which merely process water, food and sunlight in order to grow and reproduce - but in the sense that one ceases to gauge the events, the persons, the places, and the things of one's environment in terms of "I" or "me" or "mine".  A person who is "empty of self" seldom has occasion even to use these pronouns.

Confusion leads to calamity, and then life, as the Buddha noted in his First Noble Truth, becomes bitter and painful.

Perform a good deed in silence and anonymity!  Forget about rejoicing.  A good deed should have a very short life, and once dead, should be quickly buried.  Let it rest in peace.  Don't keep trying to resuscitate it.  Too often, we try to turn a good deed into a ghost that haunts people, that keeps reminding them of our wonderful service - just in case they start to forget.
